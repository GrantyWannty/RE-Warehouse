Minecraft Railway Empire -=- Warehouse
Welcome to my Github structures! Either from visiting here, or linked by my youtube channel, you can find all my Minecraft Create structures, based off of the game Railway Empire. I try to put as much detail as I can in these to be as closly related to the actual structures

This structure is the Warehouse. Acts like both kinds of stations. 
This structure is what can store several products whether from products created in the country or produced in cities. These are the imports. Then, trains can load these products and send them elsewhere, whether that's another warehouse or to cities. These are exports.
Great to use so not as much track must string over to cities, which if not using, therefore causing traffic jams and/or increasing wait times.
